@article{Matyskiela2013,
	Abstract = {The 26S proteasome is the major eukaryotic ATP-dependent protease, responsible for regulating the proteome through degradation of ubiquitin-tagged substrates. Its regulatory particle, containing the heterohexameric AAA+ ATPase motor and the essential deubiquitinase Rpn11, recognizes substrates, removes their ubiquitin chains and translocates them into the associated peptidase after unfolding, but detailed mechanisms remain unknown. Here we present the 26S proteasome structure from Saccharomyces cerevisiae during substrate degradation, showing that the regulatory particle switches from a preengaged to a translocation-competent conformation. This conformation is characterized by a rearranged ATPase ring with uniform subunit interfaces, a widened central channel coaxially aligned with the peptidase and a spiral orientation of pore loops that suggests a rapid progression of ATP-hydrolysis events around the ring. Notably, Rpn11 moves from an occluded position to directly above the central pore, thus facilitating substrate deubiquitination concomitant with translocation.},

	Abstract = {Recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to the 26S proteasome lies at the heart of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Genetic studies suggest a role for the multiubiquitin chain binding proteins (MCBPs) Rad23 and Rpn10 in recruitment, but biochemical studies implicate the Rpt5 ATPase. We addressed this issue by analyzing degradation of the ubiquitinated Cdk inhibitor Sic1 (UbSic1) in vitro. Mutant rpn10Delta and rad23Delta proteasomes failed to bind or degrade UbSic1. Although Rpn10 or Rad23 restored UbSic1 recruitment to either mutant, rescue of degradation by Rad23 uncovered a requirement for the VWA domain of Rpn10. In vivo analyses confirmed that Rad23 and the multiubiquitin binding domain of Rpn10 contribute to Sic1 degradation. Turnover studies of multiple UPS substrates uncovered an unexpected degree of specificity in their requirements for MCBPs. We propose that recruitment of substrates to the proteasome by MCBPs provides an additional layer of substrate selectivity in the UPS.},

@article{Saeki2009,
	Abstract = {The 26S proteasome is a highly conserved multisubunit protease that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in eukaryotic cells. The 26S proteasome consists of the proteolytic core particle (CP) and one or two 19S regulatory particles (RPs). Although the mechanisms of CP assembly are well described, the mechanism of RP assembly is largely unknown. Here, we show that four proteasome-interacting proteins (PIPs), Nas2/p27, Nas6/gankyrin, Rpn14/PAAF1, and Hsm3/S5b, bind specific Rpt subunits of the RP and interact each other genetically. Lack of these PIPs resulted in defective assembly of the 26S proteasome at an early stage, suggesting that these proteins are bona fide RP chaperones. Each of the RP chaperones formed distinct specific subassemblies of the base components and escorted them to mature RPs. Our results indicate that the RP assembly is a highly organized and elaborate process orchestrated by multiple proteasome-dedicated chaperones.},

@article{Kaneko2009,
	Abstract = {The 26S proteasome is an enzymatic complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in eukaryotic cells. It is composed of the 20S core particle (CP) and the 19S regulatory particle (RP). The latter is further divided into the lid and base subcomplexes. While the mechanism involved in the assembly of the CP is well investigated, that of the RP is poorly understood. Here, we show that the formation of the mammalian base subcomplex involves three distinct modules, where specific pairs of ATPase subunits are associated with the distinct chaperones p28, S5b, or p27. The process of base formation starts from association of the p28-Rpt3-Rpt6-Rpn14 complex with the S5b-Rpt1-Rpt2-Rpn1 complex, followed by incorporation of the p27-Rpt5-Rpt4 complex and Rpn2, where p28, S5b, and p27 regulate the associations between the modules. These chaperones dissociate before completion of 26S proteasome formation. Our results demonstrate that base assembly is facilitated by multiple proteasome-dedicated chaperones, like CP assembly.},

@article{Park2013,
	Abstract = {The proteasomal ATPase ring, comprising Rpt1-Rpt6, associates with the heptameric alpha-ring of the proteasome core particle (CP) in the mature proteasome, with the Rpt carboxy-terminal tails inserting into pockets of the alpha-ring. Rpt ring assembly is mediated by four chaperones, each binding a distinct Rpt subunit. Here we report that the base subassembly of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteasome, which includes the Rpt ring, forms a high-affinity complex with the CP. This complex is subject to active dissociation by the chaperones Hsm3, Nas6 and Rpn14. Chaperone-mediated dissociation was abrogated by a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, indicating that chaperone action is coupled to nucleotide hydrolysis by the Rpt ring. Unexpectedly, synthetic Rpt tail peptides bound alpha-pockets with poor specificity, except for Rpt6, which uniquely bound the alpha2/alpha3-pocket. Although the Rpt6 tail is not visualized within an alpha-pocket in mature proteasomes, it inserts into the alpha2/alpha3-pocket in the base-CP complex and is important for complex formation. Thus, the Rpt-CP interface is reconfigured when the lid complex joins the nascent proteasome to form the mature holoenzyme.},

	Abstract = {The proteasome is the major ATP-dependent protease in eukaryotic cells, but limited structural information restricts a mechanistic understanding of its activities. The proteasome regulatory particle, consisting of the lid and base subcomplexes, recognizes and processes polyubiquitinated substrates. Here we used electron microscopy and a new heterologous expression system for the lid to delineate the complete subunit architecture of the regulatory particle from yeast. Our studies reveal the spatial arrangement of ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitinating enzymes and the protein unfolding machinery at subnanometre resolution, outlining the substrate's path to degradation. Unexpectedly, the ATPase subunits within the base unfoldase are arranged in a spiral staircase, providing insight into potential mechanisms for substrate translocation through the central pore. Large conformational rearrangements of the lid upon holoenzyme formation suggest allosteric regulation of deubiquitination. We provide a structural basis for the ability of the proteasome to degrade a diverse set of substrates and thus regulate vital cellular processes.},

@article{Sledz2013,
	Abstract = {The 26S proteasome is a 2.5-MDa, ATP-dependent multisubunit proteolytic complex that processively destroys proteins carrying a degradation signal. The proteasomal ATPase heterohexamer is a key module of the 19S regulatory particle; it unfolds substrates and translocates them into the 20S core particle where degradation takes place. We used cryoelectron microscopy single-particle analysis to obtain insights into the structural changes of 26S proteasome upon the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. The ATPase ring adopts at least two distinct helical staircase conformations dependent on the nucleotide state. The transition from the conformation observed in the presence of ATP to the predominant conformation in the presence of ATP-gammaS induces a sliding motion of the ATPase ring over the 20S core particle ring leading to an alignment of the translocation channels of the ATPase and the core particle gate, a conformational state likely to facilitate substrate translocation. Two types of intersubunit modules formed by the large ATPase domain of one ATPase subunit and the small ATPase domain of its neighbor exist. They resemble the contacts observed in the crystal structures of ClpX and proteasome-activating nucleotidase, respectively. The ClpX-like contacts are positioned consecutively and give rise to helical shape in the hexamer, whereas the proteasome-activating nucleotidase-like contact is required to close the ring. Conformational switching between these forms allows adopting different helical conformations in different nucleotide states. We postulate that ATP hydrolysis by the regulatory particle ATPase (Rpt) 5 subunit initiates a cascade of conformational changes, leading to pulling of the substrate, which is primarily executed by Rpt1, Rpt2, and Rpt6.},
